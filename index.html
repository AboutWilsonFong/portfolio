                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I do not believe there is a cap to knowledge. As a result, whether I am developing the skill to fix home appliances or
                    working on a report, I am constantly considering where there is room for me to improve. Being uncertainty avoidance, it
                    is safe to assume that I don't work well in ambiguous environments. However, that is not the case, my urge to avoid
                    uncertainty coupled with my innate ability to learn quickly allows me to cope well with ambiguity. If there is an
                    problem, I have no issue seeking guidance from others and/or actively seek out answers myself whether that be obtaining
                    new knowledge or a completely new skill.
                    
                    I have a high cultural awareness and an adept global mindset. These two characteristics have helped me elevate my
                    thinking to a higher level. I always look at everyone’s perspectives and abilities the same way I look at the bigger
                    picture in projects. I am someone who values the the supply chain operations of a case analysis as much as the
                    marketing operations. This has allowed me to perform high level due diligence and produce value creating proposals.</p>

                    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                    <p>Three notable things I enjoy in life aside from music and building long lasting relationships is cooking,
                    exploring,
                    and my plastic model hobby.
                    I do not consider myself the best cook, however I do find a sense of self fulfillment after learning a
                    new recipe. My first attempt at a new recipe usually is disastrous, however, I am improving to the point where I
                    can potentially avoid this stage altogether. Currently, my most prized dish is butter chicken that I would choose
                    over any restaurant offered variation.
                
                    I spend a large portion of my free time during good weather exploring. I am from Alberta, as a result, hiking
                    trails
                    are vast. I usually plan with friends to take a hike and explore somewhere new while visiting familiar places
                    along the
                    way. I love the outdoors and the peace it provides my mind.
                
                    The last thing I enjoy doing on my free time dates back to my earliest memory, Gundam plastic model kits. This
                    hobby is
                    really where it all started, I developed an aptitude for precision and attention to detail. It is a hobby based
                    on an animated TV series, similar to building plastic airplanes and ships. The applications of the skills and experiences
                    gained are limitless. For example, I learned the fundamental process of painting from this hobby. Turns out,
                    applying paint in any scenario follows a similar procedure: prime/base, colour, and top/protective coat. I even went so
                    far to applying this hobby to my academic life. A large reason for my attention to detail comes from the hobby and my
                    desire to make each of my creations as perfect as I can make it, each time improving on the preceding experience.</p>

                    <h2>Currently</h2>
                    <p>I am enrolled at the University of Victoria to complete a Master of Global Business degree. This program
                    requires me to learn the business context of North America then physically go to France, Montpellier to learn the
                    business context of Europe. While in France, I will be studying at Montpellier Business School and I am given the
                    opportunity to work with real companies and develop proposals for their issues using my analytical and research skills.
                    From France, I am required to head to South Korea, Seoul by February. In Seoul I will be enrolled at Sungkyunkwan
                    University (SKKU) where I will be partaking in a consulting project with a Company in Korea.
                    
                    I am also doing a dual degree in conjunction with the Master of Global business at at Montpellier Business School;
                    Master of Science. This degree requires me to complete a thesis and is more research based in comparison to the Master
                    of Global business. Both the degrees have honed my cultural awareness and global mindset. Overall, my business acumen
                    has been elevated. Thereby, equipping me with the necessary skills and knowledge to formulate practical yet visionary
                    solutions for complex domestic and international business challenges.</p>

                    <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
                    <p>The purpose of this report is to analyze and make recommendations for the inventory control system currently
                        utilized by the Country Hills Home Depot in Calgary, Alberta. An in depth analysis of Home Depot’s inventory processes,
                        which is divided among three different processes: Manual, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), and Vendor Managed
                        Inventory (VMI) will be conducted. As well, an analysis of Home Depot’s communications and inter-store transfer system
                        will also be conducted, followed by a number of potential solutions. Of the solutions, the promotion of communication and
                        implementation of a standardized system is recommended, as well as updating the current electronic data
                        interchange system. This can be achieved through the services of a third party such as JDA. This recommendation provides
                        the most complete solution, recognizing improvements over every aspect of the current system. While this report is
                        focused primarily on the Country Hills Home Depot, many of the issues discussed will be common among a number of other
                        Home Depot locations. As such, the recommendations made in this report are not necessarily location specific and can
                        be considered as potentially viable solutions to inventory management issues of the same nature at other Home
                        Depot stores. It is also advised that Home Depot conduct further research, both in our recommendation as well in
                        their competitors to consider the systems they use and if they may provide any improvements to the current system.</p>

                                    <p>Our final recommendation to improve the inventory management system currently utilized by Home Depot is to increase
                                        communication within the supply chain and standardize their inventory control processes through the implementation
                                        of
                                        revised forecasting methods and systems. Increasing communication within the supply chain will promote cooperation
                                        (Thomas & Griffin, 1996), both within stores and between stores, and will help to address larger issues related to
                                        performance and inventory itself.</p>
                                    <p>By standardizing their forecasting techniques, Home Depot will see a reduction in the occurrence of over and
                                        understocking, as well as the Bullwhip Effect. This will benefit Home Depot greatly because, not only will the
                                        overall
                                        performance of inventory management system be improved, but the issue of holding costs associated with overstocking
                                        will also be addressed.</p>
                                    <p>In standardizing their forecasting system, a third party program like JDA would provide a significant upgrade over
                                        the
                                        C3 system currently utilized by Home Depot. Of the packages JDA offers on their website, the inventory management,
                                        demand management, and supply chain planning packages would likely be the most effective to address the issues that
                                        we
                                        have discussed in this report.</p>
                                    <p>JDA software will help improve Home Depot’s stock issues, specifically those related to inventory holes and
                                        understocking, through the adjustment of inventory policies and ordering strategies. JDA will further improve Home
                                        Depot’s forecasting accuracy with its integration of multiple forecasting methods into the framework it uses. These
                                        improvements will allow Home Depot’s forecasts to better reflect real time factors such as the market and/or
                                        customer
                                        demand, Team 3 Team Research Project Inventory Control 19 | P a g e as well as random variations in demand due to
                                        one-off events. Additionally, JDA will also assist in optimizing supply chain planning by reducing the amount of
                                        manual
                                        forecasting and planning currently required by department managers, ultimately reducing the risk of employee

                    <p>The “Ubiquitous Environment” is a South Korean notion for how wireless technology is encroaching upon all aspects of
                    daily living. The opportunity presented by this is clear in the fitness market, where consumers are embracing a growing
                    trend of wearable activity trackers. As consumers take up greater interest in measuring health factors such as calories
                    burned, steps taken, and resting heart rate, one significant feature remains to be seen in wearable products: body fat

                    strategic alliance. Samsung Electronics’ Gear Fit activity tracker has been losing market share in China against
                    competitors such as Xiaomi and Apple (Samsung Electronics, 2016). As a competitive strategy, Samsung Electronics
                    regularly introduces new features to differentiate. By equipping the next edition of the Gear Fit with NW Tech’s body
                    fat analysis technology, the strategic alliance will be first to market with the feature and regain lost market share.</p>
                    <p>As a market entry strategy, joining an established company in a strategic alliance offers tremendous advantages. NW
                    Tech will benefit from Samsung Electronics’ brand loyalty, existing sales funnel infrastructure, and preferential
                    access to key vendors including FOXCONN Technology Group and Samsung Electronics Logitech. This will allow the business
                    to outsource competitively and with minimal costs to manufacture the units in Taiwan, export them to warehouses in
                    China, and deliver them directly to customers in the major urban centres of Tianjin, Shanghai, Fujian, and Guangdong.</p>
                    <p>Using a price skimming strategy, the new Gear Fit NW will be marketed to affluent Chinese shoppers who are eager to
                    obtain the latest consumer technologies and track their health and fitness goals. This growing demographic seeks
                    foreign brands and is more willing to pay premium prices for luxury goods. The target market also prefers to buy
                    online, as approximately 77% of activity wearables in China are purchased on the internet. By targeting the athletic,
                    overweight, and middle-aged segments of this demographic with internet and TV advertising, the venture’s total market
                    potential in China amounts to 207,350,000 customers with industry-wide sales of 35,000,000 activity trackers in 2017.</p>
                    <p>With an initial adoption rate of 1% of market share in the first year, Samsung Electronics’ forecasted revenue for the
                    first year is approximately CAD 116,696,250. In exchange for NW Tech’s intellectual property, NW Tech’s primary revenue
                    stream will be a royalty rate of 10% of the price of each Gear Fit NW sold. This will yield NW Tech revenue of CAD
                    11,669,625 and net income of CAD 884,408 in the first year. These figures, along with growth projections for subsequent
                    years, demonstrate the direct exporting venture’s mutual profitability and that NW Tech should pursue it.</p>

                                        products carry in the eyes of consumers makes price skimming strategies justifiable. The innovative Gear Fit NW is
                                        priced at a level comparable to competition such as Fitbit; consumers would only be paying 10% more. Additionally,

                                        environmentally friendly (Samsung, 2008). This means the product can also cater to environmentally concerned
                                        consumers.</p>
                                    <p>Large capital expenditures will not be needed because Samsung Electronics already owns preexisting capital.

                                        brick and mortar capital is not needed given the emphasis on E-commerce. Furthermore, Samsung Electronics’ brand

                                        profit margin of 15% (see Appendix A). Additionally, there is an expected 32% sales growth in the second year of

                                        has also taken precautionary measures to protect the firm from international business risks, such as attaining
                                        insurance from Export Development Canada. Given the opportunities and vast benefits in China, NW Tech can see

                                        growth and profits from this strategic alliance. Measures taken to mitigate risk ensures that NW Tech, alongside

                    <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
                    <p>Nike traditionally manufactures and markets athletic apparel and footwear. With Samsung’s assistance, the firm wants to
                    diversify their product mix by entering the wearable electronics industry with a smart watch; the NS Smart Watch. This
                    market research report is directed towards Nike. Upon market entry, Nike wants to achieve the strategic objective of
                    entering a profitable market that can sustain growth, develop an innovative and desirable smart watch, access to
                    markets with the opportunity to generate international presence, market share and brand recognition, and gaining
                    experience manufacturing wearable electronics. The report will justify the viability of exporting to China and the
                    United Arab Emirates (UAE) using the strategic objectives as a guideline for research. To elaborate, the research
                    gathered will provide confidence in market entry and ensure the integrity of conducting operations is not jeopardized
                    by any factors residing in each country. After assessing each market and industry in the countries were comparatively
                    weighted. The result of this process held China as the country with the most potential. China’s market size far
                    surpasses the UAE, and the consumer attitudes and trends are highly suitable for the NS Smart Watch. Nike gains a
                    competitive advantage via the integrated camera function that the NS Smart Watch will have. There is a large demand for
                    innovation in the market, and this is a key reason why international companies in China are failing to take a
                    substantial market share. As a result, given the lack of international competition there is an opportunity in China to
                    gain international presence, growth, and brand recognition. Furthermore, given the sheer size of China’s target market,
                    the lower growth rate still results in a significant increase in population. Overall, after comparing research data,
                    China holds a more promising market for Nike to enter. To provide insight on the steps necessary in undertaking this
                    market entry, an action plan will be provided at the end of this report. Recommendations for further research will be
                    found in the action plan and it will also include steps to validate the research compiled in this report.</p>

                                            <li>c. China has a large market for electronic wearable. Although the growth is slower than the UAE’s, the
                                                sheer volume of
                                                potential consumers outweighs profit prospects in the UAE.</li>
                                            <li>d. Considering operational costs and the tax regime of each country, Nike has determined that China will

                                            <li>c. Consumers who are tech savvy, trendy, fitness oriented and health conscious will be early adopters, and

                                            <li>b. 51% of consumers use WeChat’s mobile payment system, this suggests that Nike’s brand will receive an

                                            <li>c. Samsung and Nike have pre-existing networks in China. Therefore, it is safe to assume that market entry
                                                will not be
                                                as difficult as it is for a firm completely new to the market. This also suggest negotiating with the

                                            <li>d. International brands in China have failed due to the lack of innovation; this will allow Nike to develop

                                            <li>a. Nike will acquire knowledge and expertise from working with Samsung. Nike’s experience in China creates
                                                an

                                            <li>c. Samsung can potentially become a partner in the long run to help Nike further expand its product line

                    <h3>Strategic Management: 72 Hour Midterm</h3>
                    <p>For the course Strategic Management, the capstone course for my bachelor degree, I worked in a team of 5 to analyze
                    Monarchia Matt International (MMI’s) and propose a recommendation within 72 hours. This assignment was designed to
                    simulate a real life scenario where a team had to complete an assignment within a tight time limit, all while,
                    developing a sound proposal. Notably, this assignment fulfilled the midterm requirement of the course.</p>
                    <p>During the 72 hours my team and I analyzed the business level strategy of MMI and conducted an external
                    macro-environment analysis via tools such as PESTEL. Following, key opportunities and threats were identified. My team
                    and I also utilized Porter's five forces and the VRIO framework. Altogether, the compiled analysis was drawn together
                    to formulate a recommendation. To provide credibility and highlight the viability of the recommendation, key
                    considerations such as pros and cons were outlined. The recommendation was complimented with an alternative strategy.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <h3>Recommendation</h3>
                    <p>Based on the external and internal analysis we recommend MMI to continue to pursue their growth strategy by expanding
                    and selling Hungarian wines.</p>
                    <p>After an internal analysis of the company it was determined that MMI’s “[biggest] issue is for Hungarian wines to be
                    accepted in the US.” For MMI to overcome this weakness to the brand image, we recommend they maintain the current
                    strategy of rebranding Hungarian wines. The company has taken action to “renaming blends to combat misconceptions” and
                    receiving high ratings from independent experts to change social conception. The pro of this movement would be
                    differentiation as one of the only Hungarian fine wine sellers and the capturing of a niche market where they overcome
                    the negative preconception attached to Hungary. The US wine retail is the largest in the world allowing for large
                    market potential. Additionally, the strength of MMI’s supply chain allows them ease of access to Hungarian wines. This
                    helps limit the supply threat that is experienced by rival competitors while providing a sustained competitive
                    advantage. The con is that if the cost of rebranding supersedes the revenue produced from Hungarian wine, it would be
                    an inefficient strategy. Additionally, opportunities with other New World wines could be lost if the company exerts too
                    much focus on Hungarian wine. However, given social complexity of the current management team and supply chain, such
                    obstacles can be resolved.</p>
                    <p>After conducting an external analysis of the industry, there is an opportunity consistent with MMI’s current growth
                    strategy. Taking into consideration of the demographics of Generation X and their tendency to opt for New World wines,
                    it would be beneficial for MMI to have an online presence. Online presence will allow further marketing towards
                    Generation X, Enthusiast, the Overwhelmed consumers of wine. Additionally, it would allow for a greater expansion of
                    distribution sales. Pros of this strategy, this will allow MMI to continue rebranding Hungarian wine while expanding
                    sales. Cons would include heavy capital expenditure for marketing and advertising initiatives and barriers such as
                    state legislation for online sale.</p>
                    <h3>Alternative Strategy</h3>
                    <p>There is also an alternative strategy for MMI to pursue low cost leadership given their current supply chain control.
                    This will allow MMI to produce a low cost wine that will compete more adequately against beverages as a whole for US
                    consumption. It would also cater to the opportunity of growing popularity of $3 bottle of wine. However we do not
                    recommend this strategy since MMI intends to maintain a high standard of quality and image of being strictly high
                    quality and are not able to achieve economies of scale.</p>
